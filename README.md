In this project, I scraped data from the Red Bus website using Selenium, a powerful web automation tool. After extracting the necessary information, I stored the data in a MySQL database for efficient management and querying. To present the results, I utilized Streamlit, a popular framework for building interactive web applications, allowing users to visualize and interact with the bus data easily.
